Extras are runs scored by a means other than a batsman hitting the ball. A batsman is not given credit for extras other than runs scored off the bat from a no ball, and the extras are tallied separately on the scorecard and count only towards the team's score. The types of Extras are No ball, Wide, Bye, Leg-bye and Penalty. 1 Penalty corresponds to 5 runs.

Find the total runs that the Extras contribute to the team's score, given the number of No-balls, wides, Byes, Leg-Byes and Penalty given off by the bowlers in an innings.

Input Format:
First line of the input contains an integer that corresponds to the number of No-balls.
