Write a program to calculate the hotel tariff. The room rent is 20% high during peak seasons [April-June, November-December]. 

Note: Use the switch construct.

Input format:

The first input containing an integer which denotes the number of the month

The second input containing the floating point number which denotes the room rent per day

The third input containing an integer which denotes the number of days stayed in the hotel

Output format:

Print the hotel tariff to be paid in floating point with 2 decimal places

Refer the sample output for formatting

Sample Input:

3

1500

2

Sample Output:

3000.00

Solution:

month=int(input())
rent=float(input())
days=int(input())
tot=1
if(month<=12):
    if((month>=4 and month<=6)or month==11 or month==12):
        tot=((rent*20/100)+rent)*days
    else:
        tot=rent*days
    print("%.2f"%tot)
else:
    print("Invalid Input")
