The newly appointed Vice-Chancellor of Anna University wanted to create an automated grading system for the students to check their grade. When a student enters a mark, the grading system displays the corresponding grade.

Write a program to solve the given problem.

Marks scored     Grade

100                        S

90 - 99                  A

80 - 89                  B

70 - 79                  C

60 - 69                  D

50 - 59                  E

<50                       F

Input format:

The input consists of one integer which corresponds to the marks scored by the student

Output format:

If a student marks greater than 100, print "Invalid Input". Otherwise, print the grade.

Sample Input:

78

Sample Output:

C

Solution:

a=int(input())
if(a==100):
    print("S")
elif a>=90 and a<=99:
    print("A")
elif a>=80 and a<=89:
    print("B")
elif a>=70 and a<=79:
    print("C")
elif a>=60 and a<=69:
    print("D")
elif a>=50 and a<=59:
    print("E")
elif a<50:
    print("F")
else:
    print("Invalid Input")
