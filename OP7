New Zealand batsmen exhibited a slow start as there were undone by Indian pace, however Tom Latham and Tim Southee displayed a creditable performance, which helped NZS put up a target of 191 runs to India.

The run rate of the batting powerplay overs (Overs 1 to 10) was considered to be X and the run rate in the remaining overs (Overs 11 to 50) was Y. Write a program to estimate the run rate of the NZ innings.

Input Format:

First line of the input contains a float value that corresponds to the run rate of the powerplay overs.

Second line of the input contains a float value that corresponds to the run rate of the remaining overs.

Output Format:

Output should display a float value that returns the run rate of NZS innings. Display the float value correct to 2 decimal places

Note: Refer the sample input & output for print statement. Bold highlighted is the output value.

Sample Input and Output1:

7.5

5.6

5.98

Sample Input and Output2:

5.0

7.8

7.24

Solution:
x=float(input())
y=float(input())
pp=x*10
t=y*40
tot=pp+t
print("%.2f"%(tot/50))
